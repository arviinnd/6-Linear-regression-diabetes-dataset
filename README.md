Dear everyone <br>
Good morning! <br>
<br>
Subject: linear regression model <br>
<br>
Respected everyone, this is a linear regression model. Ten variables, age, sex, body mass index, average blood pressure, and six blood 
serum measurements were obtained for each of n = 442 diabetes patients from the diabetes dataset. We have to :
<br> <br>
1. Find the coefficients
2. Find mean squared error
3. Find the variance score
4. Plot the regression line
<br>
Thansk and regards, <br>
Yours Sincerely <br>
Narayanan Arvind
